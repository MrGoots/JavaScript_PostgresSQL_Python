                        <p>The use of analytics by business can be found as far back as the 19th century when Frederick Winslow Taylor initiated time management exercises to improve industrial efficiency. In the late 1930s, analytics began receiving more attention as computers became decision-making support systems. Data analytics has evolved significantly with the development of big data, data warehouses, and a variety of software and hardware.</p>
                        <p>The development of relational databases in the 1970s and non-relational databases with the advancement of the internet in the 1990s ushered in the era of "Big Data" and a new frontier for employment opportunities in data analytics. The origin of the modern data analyst was born out of the use case demands of the internet. Over the past 10 years, the need for data analysts has grown exponentially as more people and companies expand their exposure to the internet.</p>
